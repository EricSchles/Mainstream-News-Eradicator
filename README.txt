Check out this Mainstream Newsfeed Eradicator I made as an add-on with code from the "Make Facebook Great Again" Extension and my friend Conner!

Anything from CNN, FOX, or MSNBC will be deleted from your newsfeed. 
Anything with over 200+ likes will also be deleted. 

To add this eradicator to your homepage: 

1. Download the zip file and open it. 
2. Go to the three vertical dots on the right side of your homepage.
3. Click More tools > Extensions
4. Click “Load unpacked extension” in the top left.
5. Select the unzipped file. 
6. Enjoy! Make sure the checkbox is checked and you’re ready to go!
